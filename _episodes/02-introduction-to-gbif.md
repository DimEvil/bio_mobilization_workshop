## GBIF—the Global Biodiversity Information Facility—is an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world's governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to data about all types of life on Earth.

### About

The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is an international network of country and organizational Participants that exists to enable free and open access to biodiversity data from all sources and to support biodiversity science, environmental research, and evidence based decision-making. GBIF operates as a federated system of distributed data publishing efforts, coordinated through a global informatics infrastructure and collaborative network. In this module, you will learn more about GBIF.

### GBIF introduction movie

In this video (03:23) you will learn about GBIF through animation. It is a co-production of SiB Colombia and GBIF Spain, both GBIF national nodes, with co-funding from GBIF Spain and Instituto de Investigación de Recursos Biológicos Alexander von Humboldt (IAvH). The video is in Spanish, but subtitles are available.

> ## Exercises 1: Investigate how your country/organization is represented in GBIF
> 
> The [GBIF website](https://www.gbif.org/) has pages dedicated to countries/economies, including for countries/economies that do not yet participate in GBIF. You can use the search box on the homepage to look up > a country/organization.
> - The tabs on these pages provide a general description of: 
>	- data available about the biodiversity of the country
>	- data published by your country/organization, 
>	- the participation of the country/organization
>	- other relevant information on the use of data by researchers in the country/organization.
>
> - Look up your country on the GBIF website.
> - Since when is Croatia a Voting participant
> - How many datasets are published by Croatia in GBIF?
> - How many Croatian institutions/organisations are publishing data? and globally?
> - Is a list of introduced and invasive alien species available for your country?
> - How well does the information available on GBIF reflect what you know about the biodiversity of your country?
> - Do you see publications from/about your country?
> - Download the Croatia Activity report
> 
> > ## Solution
> > 1. [Find Croatia on this map](https://www.gbif.org/the-gbif-network)
> > 2. [Since 2022](https://www.gbif.org/country/HR/summary)
> > 3. [2](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/search?publishing_country=HR)
> > 4. [2](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/search?publishing_country=HR) & [gloablly](https://www.gbif.org/publisher/search)
> > 5. [Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species- Croatia] (https://www.gbif.org/dataset/f82a4f7f-6f84-4b58-82e6-6b41ec9a1f49)
> > 6. Note your idea about this
> > 7. [publications](https://www.gbif.org/country/HR/publications/about)
> > 8. [activity report](https://www.gbif.org/sites/default/files/gbif_analytics/country/HR/GBIF_CountryReport_HR.pdf)

> ## Exercises 2: Downloading data from GBIF
> 
> The [GBIF website](https://www.gbif.org/) has pages dedicated to data retrieval and downloading. 
> 1. Find and download this occurrence only dataset from GBIF: "Tipuloidea of Martinique - 2016-2018"
> 2. Find and download this sampling event dataset from GBIF: "Meetnetten.be - Chorus counts for Amphibia in Flanders, Belgium'
> 3. Find and investigate this checklist on GBIF: https://www.gbif.org/dataset/fd004d9a-2ea4-4244-bb60-0df508d20a15
> > How many times is this dataset cited
> > 
> > How many occurrences are in this dataset?
> > 
> > Are all the occurrences georeferenced?
> > 
> > What is the licence on the dataset?
> > 
> > Which sampling method was used to collect the specimen?
> > 
> > Is there any media vailable about this dataset?
> > 
> > How should you cite this dataset?
> > 
> > What is the DOI of this dataset?
