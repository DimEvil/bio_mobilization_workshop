> ## Excercise : FAIR data & Open Science
> 
> 1. What is the difference between FAIR and OPEN data?
> 2. Check the FAIR Self assessment tool [here](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/fair-data-self-assessment-tool/) Think about a dataset you know and run over the assessment
> 3. What could you do to make your data more FAIR?
> 4. Is data published through GBIF FAIR?
> 5. Is all data published by GBIF considered as open data?
>    
> > ## SOLUTION
> > 1. FAIR data is not always open, FAIR data is findable and good documented. Open data per definition is not always FAIR. (Just an Excel somewhere on a website is considered as open data)
> > 2.
> > 3. Publish your data in GBIF or in another open repository like Zenodo 
> > 3. YES
> > 4. No, CC-BY-NC is not considered as open data
