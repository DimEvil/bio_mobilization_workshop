> ## Excercise : FAIR data & Open Science
> 
> 1. What is the difference between FAIR and OPEN data?
> 2. Check the FAIR Self assessment tool [here](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/fair-data-self-assessment-tool/) Think about a dataset you know and run over the assessment
> 3. What could you do to make your data more FAIR?
> 4. Is data published through GBIF FAIR?
> 5. Is all data published by GBIF considered as open data?
>    
> > ## SOLUTION
> > 1. FAIR data is not always open, FAIR data is findable and good documented. Open data per definition is not always FAIR. (Just an Excel somewhere on a website is considered as open data)
> > 2. <img src="{{ 'assets/img/extra/fair.PNG' | relative_url }}" alt="fair" width="400">{: .image-with-shadow }
> > 3. Publish your data in GBIF or in another open repository like Zenodo 
> > 3. YES
> > 4. No, CC-BY-NC is not considered as open data

> ## Excercise : Creative commons license chooser
> 
> 1. Check the [Creative commons license chooser](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/)
> 2. Learn how to find an appropriate license for your biodiversity data
> 3. Is this license alowed for GBIF?
> 4. Is CC-BY-NC an open data license?
>    
> > ## SOLUTION
> > 1. <img src="{{ 'assets/img/extra/creativecommons.PNG' | relative_url }}" alt="cc" width="400">{: .image-with-shadow }
> > 2. Check the license chooser
> > 3. The only licenses allowed for GBIF are CC0 ; CC_BY ; and CC_BY_NC
> > 4. CC-BY-NC is not considered as an open data license
