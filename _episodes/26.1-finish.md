## GBIF's Technical Support Hour
The theme for March session of the Technical Support Hour for nodes is **GBIFâ€™s data quality workflow**. We will go through how published data is processed in terms of quality checks, show how you can get an overview of the flags and issues of datasets, how users provide publically accessible feedback and how you can navigate the feedback yourself. 
### [Registration](https://www.gbif.org/event/123JskXfrvbKFD9P9zmgCi/technical-support-hour-for-gbif-nodes-march-2024)

The event will take place on the **6th of March 2024 at 4pm CET (UTC+1)**
