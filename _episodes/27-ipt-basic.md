GBIF—the Global Biodiversity Information Facility—is an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world's governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to data about all types of life on Earth.

* IPT management
*  Extensions

# GBIF supports publication, discovery and use of four classes of data:

* *Resource metadata*
* *Checklist Data*
* *Occurrence Data*
* *Sampling Event Data*

At the simplest, GBIF enables sharing information describing a biodiversity data resource – even when no further digital information is currently available from the resource. Other data classes support an increasingly richer and wider range of information on species, their distributions and abundance.

Data publishers are strongly encouraged to share their data using the richest appropriate data class. This maximizes the usefulness of the data for users.

To give yourself an introduction to how the IPT can be used to publish biodiversity data through GBIF.org, it’s highly recommended watching this concise 25 minute live demo below:

# Prerequisites

You require an account on a GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) to publish your data.

**Hint:** it is highly recommended that you save yourself time and money by requesting an account on an IPT located at a data hosting centre in your country or community.

**Hint:** you could install and maintain your own IPT instance if you have technical skills and capacity to maintain it online near 100% of the time.

**Hint:** if no data hosting centre exists in your country, and you or your organization don’t have the technical skills and capacity to host an IPT, you can contact the GBIF Helpdesk <helpdesk@gbif.org> for assistance.

Assuming that you would like to register your dataset with GBIF and make it globally discoverable via GBIF.org, your dataset must be affiliated with an organization that is registered with GBIF.

**Hint:** to register your organization with GBIF, start by completing this online questionnaire. The registration process can take days, so in parallel you can proceed to publish your data.

**Hint:** if you aren’t affiliated with any organization, you can contact the GBIF Helpdesk <helpdesk@gbif.org> for assistance. In the meantime, you can proceed to publish your data.
