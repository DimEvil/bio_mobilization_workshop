Participant nodes play an essential role in promoting the use of biodiversity data mobilized by the GBIF network. To further support their engagement across national, institutional, regional and thematic levels, the GBIF Secretariat has developed a fully hosted service that provides simple, customizable biodiversity data portals to GBIF Participant nodes and their partners.

Each hosted portal is a simple website hosted and maintained on the GBIF infrastructure. The programme complements other tools available through the network by lowering the technical threshold for maintaining a branded web presence displaying a targeted subset of the data and information already available through GBIF.org.

## What is a hosted portal?

A hosted portal is a simple, branded and fully customizable website that displays a targeted subset of GBIF-mediated data to support Participant nodes and their partners.

This service is designed to support biodiversity data use and engagement at national, institutional, regional and thematic scales.

## Who is it for?

A hosted portal can benefit Participant nodes and publishers that need a simple yet fully functional data portal.

By lowering the technical demands for delivering biodiversity data, hosted portals can enable a focus on other critical activities like data management and community engagement.

## How to apply

Participant nodes and their partner institutions can apply to participate in GBIF's hosted portal programme at any time.
