# Becoming a data publishers


## 1. Secure institutional agreements

Before to share data through the GBIF network, you should alert administrators of your plans to publish on behalf of your institution.
Sharing **open data** will increase the visibility of your institution, building on traditional methods like **academic publications and specimen loans** to bring new collaboration opportunities and international recognition through DOI-based citations.

## 2. Request Endorsement

To become a data publisher, your organization must request endorsement from the GBIF community. 
Once you have reviewed the data publisher agreement and agree in principle to share data, we encourage you to request endorsement for your organization as soon as possible to avoid delays in publishing data.
### Data Publisher Agreement
Terms and conditions:
- [ ] I have read and understood GBIF's Data Publisher Agreement and agree to its terms.
- [ ] I understand that I am seeking registration on behalf of my organization, and confirm that the responsible authorities of my organization are aware of this registration.
- [ ] I understand that my organizational information, including the contact details provided, will be made publicly available through GBIF.org.

see on [GBIF.org](https://www.gbif.org/terms/data-publisher
)

### Data user agreement
It is also important for data publishers to carefully read
the agreement between GBIF and data users
see on [GBIF.org](https://www.gbif.org/terms/data-user)

## 3. Select your publishing tools and partners
Your data may arrive to GBIF via different ways, or tools.
Today, much of the data arrive from the Integrated Publishing Toolkit(IPT) installed at the institution, at the natioan node, at GBIF Secretariat(hosted IPT) or elesewhere.
The Living Atlases platform, originally developed by the Atlas of Living Australia, also offers data publication.

Other alternatives exist: fully automated based on GBIF API or simply by putting on the web (HTTP installation).

## 4. Data Management Plan
As Data publishers, you will decide:
 - the **data you want to publish** to GBIF
 - the **dataflow** between you and GBIF
 - the **tools** you will use for publishing
 - the **richness and precision** of your data
 - the **license/waiver** you want to apply yo your date
 - the description of your data(**metadata**)
 - the **contacts** for your institution and datasets

We would suggest you to document all this in your institution/unit **Data Management Plan**.

## Exercise
Please take some time to  answer these questions:
- Is your institution ready to become a data publisher?
- What are your reasons or incentive?
- What are your fears or reticence?
- Do you need to convince your management?
- Do you have enough arguments for that?


## Incentives for publishing open-access biodiversity data
An important part of GBIF's mission is to promote a culture in which people recognize the benefits of publishing open-access biodiversity data, for themselves as well as for the broader society.

By making your data discoverable and accessible through GBIF and similar information infrastructures, you will contribute to global knowledge about biodiversity, and thus to the solutions that will promote its conservation and sustainable use.
Data publishing enables datasets held all over the world to be integrated, revealing new opportunities for collaboration among data owners and researchers.
Publishing data enables individuals and institutions to be properly credited for their work to create and curate biodiversity data, by giving visibility to publishing institutions through good metadata authoring. This recognition can be further developed if you author a peer-reviewed data paper, giving scholarly recognition to the publication of biodiversity datasets.
Collection managers can trace usage and citations of digitized data published from their institutions and accessed through GBIF and similar infrastructures.
Some funding agencies now require researchers receiving public funds to make data freely accessible at the end of a project.
