# CROMENT Workshop on biodiversity data and the GBIF network 2024

This repository is for participants to get general information and ask questions related to the Croment Workshop (via the [issues](https://github.com/DimEvil/bio_mobilization_workshop/issues) section).

The hands on data workshop is an interactive virtual workshop focused on mobilizing biological observation datasets to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility by helping data providers standardize their data using Darwin Core. This includes species observations from any type of sampling methodologies (e.g. visual surveys, microscopy, imaging, telemetry).
